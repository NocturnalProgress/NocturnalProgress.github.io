            <h1>How COVID-19 Spreads</h1>
            <p>
                According to the CDC, COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person. It can spread between people who
                are in close contact, through droplets that can land in the mouths or noses of those nearby, and it
                could be spread bt people who aren't even showing symptoms.

            <h1>How to Prevent the Spread of COVID-19</h1>
            <p>
                To prevent the spread of COVID-19, you should wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at
                least 20 seconds especially after being in a public palce. If soap and water isn't availible, the CDC
                recommends using a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. It is also highly recommended
                (sometimes required in certain places) to cover your face with a cloth mask when going out in public.
                The CDC also recommends that frequently touched surfaces should be cleaned and disinfecting daily.

            <h1>What is Social Distancing?</h1>
            <p>
                Social Distancing means staying away from others.
                The Center for Disease Control recommends that you should stay at least six feet away from others, avoid
                mass gatherings, and stay out of crowded places. The CDC also says that Social Distancing is the best
                way to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Since it's possible to spread the virus before knowing your sick,
                it's very important to stay away from others as much as possible even if they have no symptoms.

            <h1>Why Practice Social Distancing?</h1>
            <p> COVID-19 spreads when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, and droplets from their mouth or
                nose land in the mouths or noses of others nearby. It is also possible to spread the virus by touching a
                surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching your face, eyes, nose, or mouth. The CDC
                says that COVID-19 can live on surfaces for hours or days depending on the sunlight, humidity, and the
                type of the surface.</p>
