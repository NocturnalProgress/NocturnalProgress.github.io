            <h1>The Dirty Thirties</h1>
            <p>The Dust Bowl (also known as the The Dirty Thirties) was a period in the 1930s that suffered severe dust
                storms during a dry period. High
                winds swept choking dust all over Texas and even into Nebraska. People and livestock were killed and
                crops failed across the entire region. The Dust Bowl intensified the devastating economic impacts of the
                Great Depression and sent many farmers on a desperate migration in search of work and better living
                conditions.</p>

            <h1>A New Deal</h1>
            <p>When Franklin D. Roosevelt took office in 1933, he acted quickly to stabilize the economy and provide
                releif to those that were suffering. In the first 100 days of FDR taking office, he asked Congress to
                take the first step toward ending
                Prohibition and in May, he signed the Tennessee Valley Authority Act into law which created the TVA and
                allowed the federal government to build dams along the Tennessee River in order to control flooding and
                generate cheap hydroelectric power for people in the region. In his first 100 days of taking office, FDR
                had won passage of 12 other major laws including the Glass-Stegal Act and the Home Owners' Loan Act.</p>

            <h1>Social Security Act</h1>
            <p>The Social Security Act was signed into law in 1935 by Franklin D. Roosevelt. This law created Social
                Security which was a federal safety net for elderly, unemployed, and disadvantaged Americans. The main
                goal of this law was to provide financial benefits to retirees over 65 based on lifetime payroll tax
                contributions. This law also established the Social Security Board which eventually became the Social
                Security Administration.</p>

            <h1>Hoovervilles</h1>
            <p>As unemployed were evicted from their homes, shantytowns began to appear. When the government failed to
                provide relief to Americans, the unpopular President Herbert Hoover was blamed and the shantytowns that
                popped up across the nation were known as Hoovervilles. Hooverville shanties were usually built out of
                salvaged materials such as cardboard, tar paper, glass, lumber, or tin. Some homes weren't even homes
                at all, sometimes they were deep holes in the ground with makeshift roofs laid over them to keep out the
                weather. Hoovervilles varied in population and size. Some were as small as a few hundred people while
                others had thousands of people.</p>
